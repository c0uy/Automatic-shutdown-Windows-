# Automatic-shutdown-Windows-

This script is used to schedule an automatic shutdown of the computer.
It will start by scheduling a timer of 30min, and will propose to you to change this value if it is not what you want.

Create a task that will execute this script (at 1am for example), so that it goes out while you fall asleep without having to get up after watching your movie.
